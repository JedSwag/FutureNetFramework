The FutureNetFramework (FNF) is designed to act as a web browser powered by the c++ programming laguage. It has three main responsibilities in achieving this goal:

	1. Networking, that is communicating data from one host to another.

	2. Rendering graphics, whether it's basic text or more advanced images the FNF must be able to render information to screen

	3. Development, the FNF will allow developers to develope web pages for others to use.


There are further goals for the FNF which while not essential, will increase the utility of the FNF:
	
	1. Compatability with HTML based web pages
