The Application Program Interface (API) for the FNF will function as follows:

	1. There will be a toolkit which will contained within the namespace "FNFAPI Toolkit".
	2. The toolkit will have both stand alone procudural functions and class based object implementations.
	3. The stand alone functions will act to establish sockets between the current instance of FNF and external instances
	4. The class based objects will utilise the functionality of the stand alone functions to initialise connectsions but will keep those
	   connections alive themselves as well as handling disposal once the connections are complete.
